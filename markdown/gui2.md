### GUI Layout Example II

We\'re continuing the theme of laying out buttons in a frame. In this
question, you\'ll need to add fixed spacing between your widgets.

You need to write a function `create_layout` that takes a frame as its
only argument and adds two buttons on top of each other in the frame.
The first (top) button should have the label `"Button1"`, and the other
should have the label `"Button2"`. The callback (command) for both
buttons should be the `pressed` function.

The first button should have 20 pixels of space above and below it. The
second button should have 20 pixels of internal space on its left and
right.

Both buttons should appear on the far left of the frame.

As in the previous question, there is no need to create a tk app (the
root window and frame will be initialised for you).

The frame should appear as depicted below.

When you check your code a window should pop up showing your layout.
Close the popup window before trying again or moving to a new problem.
