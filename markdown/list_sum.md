### Summing Elements of a List

Python comes with a built-in function `sum` that adds together all the
elements of a list of numbers. For this problem you will write your own
version.

Write a function definition of `sum_elems` using a for loop that takes a
list of numbers, and returns the sum of all the elements of the list.
Your solution must not use the built-in function `sum`.
