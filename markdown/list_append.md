### Transforming a List

One typical kind of list processing is to transform the elements of a
list, producing a copy of the list but with the elements transformed.

Write a function definition of `add_sizes` using a for loop that takes a
list of strings, say `strings`, and returns a list of pairs consisting
of the elements of `strings` together with their lengths.
