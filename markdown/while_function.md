### Writing a Function Using While

Write a function `div_3_5(start, end)` that computes the number of
integers from `start` up to, but not including `end` that are divisible
by 3 or 5 using a while loop.

Examples:\
`div_3_5(7, 27)` evaluates to 9 ( numbers divisible by 3 or 5 in that
range: 9,10,12,15,18,20,21,24,25)\
