### Accessing String Elements

First note that all iterable objects (such as strings) \"start counting
from index 0\". This means that the first element of a string is at
index 0.

Prompt for a single string (using `input`), and print the first, second,
and last characters of this string (on separate lines). You may assume
that the string has enough characters.

For example, if the input string is `"Spam"`, then you should print
`"S"`, `"p"`, and `"m"`.
