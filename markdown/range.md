### Using Range

The built-in function `range` returns an iterable sequence of numbers.

Write a function `sum_range(start, end)` which uses `range` to return
the sum of the numbers from `start` up to, but not including, `end`.
(Including `start` but excluding `end` is the default behaviour of
`range`.)

Write a function `sum_evens(start, end)` which does the same thing, but
which only includes even numbers. You should also use `range`.
