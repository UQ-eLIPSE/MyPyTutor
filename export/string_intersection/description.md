### Intersecting Strings

Write a function `intersection(str1, str2)` which returns the
intersection of `str1` and `str2`. (Intersection means that one of the
characters in `str2` occurs somewhere in `str1`.) Each letter should be
represented at most once in the output.

The letters should be in the order they appear in the first string. You
should use a for loop to iterate over the first string.
