### Finding Digits in Strings

This task is to implement a function `get_digits(str1)` that takes a
string as input, and returns the string of digits in `str1` in the order
they appear in `str1`.

You should use a for loop to iterate over the string.

You will find a built-in string method very useful. Remember that you
can get a list of all string method with `dir(str)`, and help on a
specific method with, eg, `help(str.split)`.
