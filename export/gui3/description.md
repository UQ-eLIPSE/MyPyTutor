### GUI Layout Example III

We\'re continuing the theme of laying out buttons in a frame. In this
question, you\'ll need to add fixed spacing between your widgets.

You need to write a function `create_layout` that takes a frame as its
only argument and adds four buttons in the layout shown below.

The callback (command) for both buttons should be the `pressed`
function.

This layout must be achieved using an additional `Frame`. You will
probably want to look at the `fill` and `expand` keyword arguments to
`pack`.

As in the previous questions, there is no need to create a tk app (the
root window and frame will be initialised for you).

When you check your code a window should pop up showing your layout.
Close the popup window before trying again or moving to a new problem.
