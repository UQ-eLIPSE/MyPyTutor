### Finding the Mean

The mean (or average) of a non-empty list of `n` numbers is the sum of
the numbers divided by `n`. For example, the mean of 2, 7, 3, 9, and 13
is (2+7+3+9+13)/5, or 6.8. Write a function `mean` that takes as input a
non-empty list of numbers (of any length \> 0) and returns the mean.
