### Slicing Strings

Any iterable object can be sliced. Slicing is used to extract a
sub-collection of elements. For example, slicing can be used to get
elements for a range of indicies.

Write a function `slice_from(string, start, end)` which returns the
characters in `string` from index `start` up to, but not including,
index `end`. (Note that this characteristic of including the character
at the start index, but not including the one at the end index, is the
default slicing behaviour.)

Write a function `reverse_string(string)` which returns the characters
in `string` in reverse order. You must use a single slice statement to
achieve this.
