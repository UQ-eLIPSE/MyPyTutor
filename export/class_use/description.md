### Using Classes

This problem relates to the pre-loaded class `Person`.

Using the `Person` class, write a function `print_friend_info(person)`
which accepts a single argument, of type `Person`, and:

-   prints out their name
-   prints out their age
-   if the person has any friends, prints `'Friends with {name}'`

Write a function `create_fry()` which returns a `Person` instance
representing Fry. Fry is 25 and his full name is `'Philip J. Fry'`

Write a function `make_friends(person_one, person_two)` which sets each
argument as the friend of the other.
